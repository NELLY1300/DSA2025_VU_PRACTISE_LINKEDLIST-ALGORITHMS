# DSA2025_VU_PRACTISE_LINKEDLIST-ALGORITHMS
Linked List Algorithms in C++
Description

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of various linked list algorithms in C++. It serves as a resource for understanding and utilizing linked lists, a fundamental data structure widely used in computer science. The project includes implementations of different types of linked lists, along with essential algorithms for insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Features

Singly Linked List : A basic linked list where each node points to the next node, allowing for unidirectional traversal.
Doubly Linked List : An advanced linked list where each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes, enabling bidirectional traversal.
Circular Linked List : A variation of linked lists where the last node points back to the first node, allowing for continuous traversal without a null reference.

Algorithms Implemented

Insertion Algorithms:
   Insert at the beginning
   Insert at the end
   Insert at a specific position

Deletion Algorithms:
   Delete the head node
   Delete the last node
   Delete a node at a specific position

Traversal Algorithms:
   Display the entire list
   Search for a specific value

Usage

To use the linked list implementations, clone the repository and compile the provided C++ files. The repository includes example code demonstrating how to create and manipulate linked lists, making it easy for users to understand the functionality and apply it to their own projects.

Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or additional algorithms to implement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
